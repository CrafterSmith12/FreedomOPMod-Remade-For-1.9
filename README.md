FreedomOPMod
============

FreedomOpMod is a Minecraft plugin created for FreedomOP, http://freedomop.boards.net/, and was orginally created for CraftBukkit servers but was adapted to "Spigot" servers however, works for both types of servers.   FreedomOpMod was orginally called TotalFreedomMod but custom features and modifications allowed us to change the name.


TotalFreedomMod plugin was originally coded by StevenLawson (Madgeek1450), with Jerom van der Sar (DarthSalamon) and later taken up for development with the following name FreedomOpMod by Buildcarter8, SupItsDillion, Robo_Lord, Pladiu, and many others including our user-based community and random strangers that want to help us.
